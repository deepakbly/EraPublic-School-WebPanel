                    <p> We are a new age educational institution founded on timeless, old world values. Era Public School is a part of the Jalahalli Education Society it is a one of the best school in bareilly. The school is a laboratory in which we aim at developing the heart and mind of the learners in an environment of freedom, respect, love and affection.  The school truly embodies the spirit of Indian Gurukula system which focuses on seeking of truth and codifying of knowledge.</p>
                    <p>In today's global, multicultural and knowledge oriented world, education is the tool that opens the door for creative thought, enterprise and trend setting adaptations and changes. But does todad's education prepare the young minds to face challenges, reach out courageously and empathetically embrace this world? Our experience cautions us before making this claim. As a team of experienced educationists, we very strongly believe the time has come, where this effort of creating world/global citizens in the chaotic and muddled world is not just a need but is our responsibility.</p>
